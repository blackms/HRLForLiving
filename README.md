# Personal Finance Optimization HRL System

A hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) system that simulates and learns to optimally allocate monthly salary among investments, savings, and discretionary spending. The system aims to maximize long-term investments while maintaining financial stability through realistic monthly economic simulation.

## Overview

The system implements a two-level hierarchical architecture:
- **High-Level Agent (Strategist)**: Defines medium-term financial strategy (6-12 months)
- **Low-Level Agent (Executor)**: Executes concrete monthly allocation actions

```

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

- `gymnasium>=0.29.0` - RL environment framework
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - Numerical computing
- `stable-baselines3>=2.0.0` - RL algorithms (PPO)
- `torch>=2.0.0` - Neural network framework
- `pyyaml>=6.0` - Configuration file parsing

## Configuration

The system supports flexible configuration through YAML files or predefined behavioral profiles.

### Configuration Manager

The `ConfigurationManager` provides two ways to configure the system:

**1. Load from YAML file:**
```python
from src.utils.config_manager import load_config

env_config, training_config, reward_config = load_config('configs/my_config.yaml')
```

**2. Load predefined behavioral profile:**
```python
from src.utils.config_manager import load_behavioral_profile

env_config, training_config, reward_config = load_behavioral_profile('balanced')
```

### Behavioral Profiles

The system includes three predefined behavioral profiles with different risk tolerances:

#### Conservative Profile
- Risk tolerance: 0.3
- Safety threshold: $1,500
- Investment reward coefficient (α): 5.0
- Stability penalty coefficient (β): 0.5
- Focus: Capital preservation and stability

#### Balanced Profile (Default)
- Risk tolerance: 0.5
- Safety threshold: $1,000
- Investment reward coefficient (α): 10.0
- Stability penalty coefficient (β): 0.1
- Focus: Balanced growth and stability

#### Aggressive Profile
- Risk tolerance: 0.8
- Safety threshold: $500
- Investment reward coefficient (α): 15.0
- Stability penalty coefficient (β): 0.05
- Focus: Maximum investment growth

### YAML Configuration Format

Create a YAML file with the following structure (see `configs/` directory for examples):

```yaml
environment:
  income: 3200
  fixed_expenses: 1400
  variable_expense_mean: 700
  variable_expense_std: 100
  inflation: 0.02
  safety_threshold: 1000
  max_months: 60
  initial_cash: 0
  risk_tolerance: 0.5

training:
  num_episodes: 5000
  gamma_low: 0.95
  gamma_high: 0.99
  high_period: 6
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate_low: 0.0003
  learning_rate_high: 0.0001

reward:
  alpha: 10.0    # Investment reward coefficient
  beta: 0.1      # Stability penalty coefficient
  gamma: 5.0     # Overspend penalty coefficient
  delta: 20.0    # Debt penalty coefficient
  lambda_: 1.0   # Wealth growth coefficient
  mu: 0.5        # Stability bonus coefficient
```

**Example Configuration Files:**
- `configs/conservative.yaml` - Conservative profile with low risk tolerance
- `configs/balanced.yaml` - Balanced profile with medium risk tolerance
- `configs/aggressive.yaml` - Aggressive profile with high risk tolerance

### Configuration Validation

The Configuration Manager automatically validates all parameters:
- Income must be positive
- Expenses must be non-negative
- Inflation must be in [-1, 1]
- Discount factors (gamma) must be in [0, 1]
- Risk tolerance must be in [0, 1]
- Learning rates must be positive
- All reward coefficients must be non-negative

Invalid configurations raise a `ConfigurationError` with a descriptive message.

## Core Components

### BudgetEnv - Financial Simulation Environment

The `BudgetEnv` is a custom Gymnasium environment that simulates monthly financial decisions with integrated multi-objective reward computation via `RewardEngine`.

**Key Integration Features:**
- Accepts optional `RewardConfig` parameter for customizing reward behavior
- Uses default reward configuration if none provided
- Automatically computes rewards using `RewardEngine.compute_low_level_reward()`
- Passes action, current state, and next state to reward engine for accurate reward calculation

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.environment import BudgetEnv
from src.utils.config import EnvironmentConfig, RewardConfig

# Create environment configuration
env_config = EnvironmentConfig(
    income=3200,              # Monthly salary
    fixed_expenses=1400,      # Fixed monthly costs
    variable_expense_mean=700, # Average variable expenses
    variable_expense_std=100, # Std dev of variable expenses
    inflation=0.02,           # Annual inflation rate
    safety_threshold=1000,    # Minimum cash buffer
    max_months=60,           # Simulation duration
    initial_cash=0,          # Starting cash balance
    risk_tolerance=0.5       # Risk profile (0-1)
)

# Create reward configuration (optional - uses defaults if not provided)
reward_config = RewardConfig(
    alpha=10.0,    # Investment reward coefficient
    beta=0.1,      # Stability penalty coefficient
    gamma=5.0,     # Overspend penalty coefficient
    delta=20.0,    # Debt penalty coefficient
    lambda_=1.0,   # Wealth growth coefficient
    mu=0.5         # Stability bonus coefficient
)

# Initialize environment with custom reward configuration
env = BudgetEnv(env_config, reward_config)

# Or use default reward configuration
env = BudgetEnv(env_config)

# Reset environment
observation, info = env.reset()

# Take a step with an action [invest_ratio, save_ratio, consume_ratio]
action = [0.3, 0.5, 0.2]  # Invest 30%, save 50%, consume 20%
observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

print(f"Cash balance: ${info['cash_balance']:.2f}")
print(f"Total invested: ${info['total_invested']:.2f}")
print(f"Reward: {reward:.2f}")
print(f"Month: {info['month']}")
```

**State Space (7-dimensional):**
- `income`: Monthly salary
- `fixed_expenses`: Fixed monthly costs
- `variable_expenses`: Sampled variable costs for current month
- `cash_balance`: Current liquid funds
- `inflation`: Current inflation rate
- `risk_tolerance`: Agent's risk profile (0-1)
- `t_remaining`: Months remaining in episode

**Action Space (3-dimensional, continuous [0, 1]):**
- `invest_ratio`: Percentage to invest (automatically normalized)
- `save_ratio`: Percentage to save (automatically normalized)
- `consume_ratio`: Percentage for discretionary spending (automatically normalized)

Actions are automatically normalized to sum to 1 using softmax.

### RewardEngine - Multi-Objective Reward Computation

The `RewardEngine` is automatically integrated with `BudgetEnv` and computes rewards balancing multiple financial objectives. You can also use it standalone for custom reward calculations.

**Standalone Usage:**
```python
from src.environment import RewardEngine
from src.utils.config import RewardConfig
import numpy as np

# Create reward configuration
reward_config = RewardConfig(
    alpha=10.0,    # Investment reward coefficient
    beta=0.1,      # Stability penalty coefficient
    gamma=5.0,     # Overspend penalty coefficient
    delta=20.0,    # Debt penalty coefficient
    lambda_=1.0,   # Wealth growth coefficient
    mu=0.5         # Stability bonus coefficient
)

# Initialize reward engine
reward_engine = RewardEngine(reward_config, safety_threshold=1000)

# Compute low-level reward for a single step
action = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.2])  # [invest, save, consume]
state = np.array([3200, 1400, 700, 2000, 0.02, 0.5, 50])
next_state = np.array([3200, 1400, 700, 1800, 0.02, 0.5, 49])
reward = reward_engine.compute_low_level_reward(action, state, next_state)

# Compute high-level reward over a strategic period
episode_history = [...]  # List of Transition objects
high_level_reward = reward_engine.compute_high_level_reward(episode_history)
```

### BudgetExecutor - Low-Level Agent

The `BudgetExecutor` is the low-level agent that executes concrete monthly allocation decisions using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). It receives both the current financial state and a strategic goal vector from the high-level agent.

**Key Features:**
- 10-dimensional input (7-dimensional state + 3-dimensional goal)
- 3-dimensional continuous action output [invest, save, consume]
- Custom policy network with [128, 128] hidden layers
- Automatic action normalization to ensure sum = 1
- PPO-based learning with discount factor γ = 0.95
- Model save/load functionality

### FinancialStrategist - High-Level Agent

The `FinancialStrategist` is the high-level agent that defines medium-term financial strategy. It observes aggregated state information and generates strategic goals for the Low-Level Agent to follow.

**Key Features:**
- 5-dimensional aggregated state input (avg_cash, avg_investment_return, spending_trend, current_wealth, months_elapsed)
- 3-dimensional goal output [target_invest_ratio, safety_buffer, aggressiveness]
- Custom policy network with [64, 64] hidden layers
- State aggregation from historical observations
- HIRO-style learning with discount factor γ = 0.99
- Automatic goal constraint enforcement (sigmoid/softplus)
- Model save/load functionality

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.agents.budget_executor import BudgetExecutor
from src.utils.config import TrainingConfig
from src.utils.data_models import Transition
import numpy as np

# Create training configuration
training_config = TrainingConfig(
    num_episodes=5000,
    gamma_low=0.95,
    gamma_high=0.99,
    high_period=6,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate_low=3e-4,
    learning_rate_high=1e-4
)

# Initialize executor
executor = BudgetExecutor(training_config)

# Generate action from state and goal
state = np.array([3200, 1400, 700, 1000, 0.02, 0.5, 50])  # Financial state
goal = np.array([0.3, 1000, 0.5])  # [target_invest_ratio, safety_buffer, aggressiveness]
action = executor.act(state, goal)

print(f"Action: invest={action[0]:.2f}, save={action[1]:.2f}, consume={action[2]:.2f}")

# Learn from experience
transitions = [
    Transition(state, goal, action, reward, next_state, done)
    for state, goal, action, reward, next_state, done in episode_data
]
metrics = executor.learn(transitions)

print(f"Training metrics: loss={metrics['loss']:.4f}, entropy={metrics['policy_entropy']:.4f}")

# Save trained model
executor.save('models/budget_executor.pth')

# Load trained model
executor.load('models/budget_executor.pth')
```

**Input Specification:**
- **State Vector (7-dimensional)**: `[income, fixed_expenses, variable_expenses, cash_balance, inflation, risk_tolerance, t_remaining]`
- **Goal Vector (3-dimensional)**: `[target_invest_ratio, safety_buffer, aggressiveness]`
- **Concatenated Input (10-dimensional)**: State + Goal

**Output Specification:**
- **Action Vector (3-dimensional)**: `[invest_ratio, save_ratio, consume_ratio]` (automatically normalized to sum = 1)

**Learning:**
The executor uses a simplified policy gradient approach with:
- Discounted returns calculation using γ_low = 0.95
- Return normalization for stable training
- Entropy bonus (0.01 coefficient) for exploration
- Adam optimizer with configurable learning rate

### Configuration Manager - System Configuration

The `ConfigurationManager` provides flexible configuration loading from YAML files or predefined behavioral profiles with automatic validation.

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Complete with YAML loading, behavioral profiles, and comprehensive validation

**Key Features:**
- Load configurations from YAML files
- Load predefined behavioral profiles (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- Automatic parameter validation with descriptive error messages
- Support for all configuration types (environment, training, reward)
- Custom ConfigurationError exception for invalid configurations

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.utils.config_manager import load_config, load_behavioral_profile, ConfigurationError

# Option 1: Load from YAML file
try:
    env_config, training_config, reward_config = load_config('configs/my_config.yaml')
except ConfigurationError as e:
    print(f"Configuration error: {e}")

# Option 2: Load predefined behavioral profile
env_config, training_config, reward_config = load_behavioral_profile('balanced')

# Use configurations
env = BudgetEnv(env_config, reward_config)
strategist = FinancialStrategist(training_config)
executor = BudgetExecutor(training_config)
```

**Behavioral Profiles:**
- **Conservative**: Low risk (0.3), high safety threshold ($1,500), lower investment rewards (α=5.0)
- **Balanced**: Medium risk (0.5), standard safety threshold ($1,000), standard rewards (α=10.0)
- **Aggressive**: High risk (0.8), low safety threshold ($500), higher investment rewards (α=15.0)

**Validation Rules:**
- Income must be positive
- Expenses must be non-negative
- Inflation must be in [-1, 1]
- Discount factors (gamma) must be in [0, 1]
- Risk tolerance must be in [0, 1]
- Learning rates must be positive
- All reward coefficients must be non-negative

### AnalyticsModule - Performance Metrics Tracking

The `AnalyticsModule` tracks and computes comprehensive performance metrics for evaluating the HRL system's financial decision-making quality.

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY TESTED** - 18 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality and edge cases

**Key Features:**
- Records step-by-step data (states, actions, rewards, goals, investments)
- Computes cumulative wealth growth (total invested capital)
- Calculates cash stability index (% months with positive balance)
- Computes Sharpe-like ratio (mean return / std balance)
- Measures goal adherence (alignment between strategic goals and actual actions)
- Tracks policy stability (variance of actions over time)
- Episode-level metric computation
- Easy reset for new episodes
- Robust edge case handling (empty data, single step, missing goals, zero variance)
- Array copying to prevent reference issues

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.utils.analytics import AnalyticsModule
import numpy as np

# Initialize analytics module
analytics = AnalyticsModule()

# Record steps during episode
for step in episode:
    state = np.array([3200, 1400, 700, 1000, 0.02, 0.5, 50])
    action = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.2])
    reward = 15.0
    goal = np.array([0.3, 1000, 0.5])
    invested_amount = 960.0  # 0.3 * 3200
    
    analytics.record_step(state, action, reward, goal, invested_amount)

# Compute metrics at episode end
metrics = analytics.compute_episode_metrics()

print(f"Cumulative wealth growth: ${metrics['cumulative_wealth_growth']:.2f}")
print(f"Cash stability index: {metrics['cash_stability_index']:.2%}")
print(f"Sharpe ratio: {metrics['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
print(f"Goal adherence: {metrics['goal_adherence']:.4f}")
print(f"Policy stability: {metrics['policy_stability']:.4f}")

# Reset for next episode
analytics.reset()
```

**Metrics Explained:**
- **Cumulative Wealth Growth**: Total amount invested over the episode, indicating long-term wealth accumulation
- **Cash Stability Index**: Percentage of months maintaining positive cash balance (0-1), higher is better
- **Sharpe-like Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric (mean balance / std balance), higher indicates better risk-adjusted performance
- **Goal Adherence**: Mean absolute difference between target investment ratio and actual investment action, lower indicates better goal following
- **Policy Stability**: Variance of actions over time, lower indicates more consistent decision-making

**Edge Case Handling:**
The module gracefully handles various edge cases:
- Empty data: Returns 0.0 for all metrics
- Single step: Correctly computes metrics (stability=1.0 if positive, sharpe=0.0, policy_stability=0.0)
- Missing goals: Returns 0.0 for goal_adherence
- Mismatched lengths: Uses minimum length between goals and actions
- Zero variance: Returns 0.0 for sharpe_ratio and policy_stability
- Array references: Automatically copies arrays to prevent mutation issues

### HRLTrainer - Training Orchestrator

The `HRLTrainer` coordinates the hierarchical training loop, managing interactions between the high-level and low-level agents. It implements the complete HRL training process where strategic goals are set periodically and monthly actions are executed continuously.

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Complete with AnalyticsModule integration

**Key Features:**
- Coordinates high-level (Strategist) and low-level (Executor) agent training
- Automatic AnalyticsModule integration for zero-overhead performance tracking
- Episode buffer for storing low-level transitions
- State history tracking for high-level state aggregation
- Comprehensive training metrics tracking (rewards, lengths, cash balances, investments, losses, and all 5 analytics metrics)
- Configurable high-level decision period (default: 6 months)
- Automatic policy updates for both agents
- Enhanced progress monitoring with stability and goal adherence metrics
- Deterministic evaluation mode with comprehensive summary statistics
- Supports both training and evaluation modes

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.training.hrl_trainer import HRLTrainer
from src.environment.budget_env import BudgetEnv
from src.agents.financial_strategist import FinancialStrategist
from src.agents.budget_executor import BudgetExecutor
from src.environment.reward_engine import RewardEngine
from src.utils.config import EnvironmentConfig, TrainingConfig, RewardConfig

# Create configurations
env_config = EnvironmentConfig(
    income=3200,
    fixed_expenses=1400,
    variable_expense_mean=700,
    variable_expense_std=100,
    inflation=0.02,
    safety_threshold=1000,
    max_months=60,
    initial_cash=0,
    risk_tolerance=0.5
)

training_config = TrainingConfig(
    num_episodes=5000,
    gamma_low=0.95,
    gamma_high=0.99,
    high_period=6,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate_low=3e-4,
    learning_rate_high=1e-4
)

reward_config = RewardConfig(
    alpha=10.0,
    beta=0.1,
    gamma=5.0,
    delta=20.0,
    lambda_=1.0,
    mu=0.5
)

# Initialize components
env = BudgetEnv(env_config, reward_config)
reward_engine = RewardEngine(reward_config, safety_threshold=1000)
strategist = FinancialStrategist(training_config)
executor = BudgetExecutor(training_config)

# Create trainer
trainer = HRLTrainer(env, strategist, executor, reward_engine, training_config)

# Train the HRL system
print("Starting training...")
training_history = trainer.train(num_episodes=5000)

# Access training metrics
print(f"\nTraining Complete!")
print(f"Final average reward: {np.mean(training_history['episode_rewards'][-100:]):.2f}")
print(f"Final average cash: {np.mean(training_history['cash_balances'][-100:]):.2f}")
print(f"Final average invested: {np.mean(training_history['total_invested'][-100:]):.2f}")

# Save trained models
strategist.save('models/strategist.pth')
executor.save('models/executor.pth')

# Evaluation
eval_metrics = trainer.evaluate(num_episodes=100)
print(f"\nEvaluation Results:")
print(f"Mean Reward: {eval_metrics['mean_reward']:.2f} ± {eval_metrics['std_reward']:.2f}")
print(f"Mean Cash Balance: ${eval_metrics['mean_cash_balance']:.2f}")
print(f"Mean Total Invested: ${eval_metrics['mean_total_invested']:.2f}")
print(f"Mean Wealth Growth: ${eval_metrics['mean_wealth_growth']:.2f}")
print(f"Mean Cash Stability: {eval_metrics['mean_cash_stability']:.2%}")
print(f"Mean Sharpe Ratio: {eval_metrics['mean_sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
print(f"Mean Goal Adherence: {eval_metrics['mean_goal_adherence']:.4f}")
print(f"Mean Policy Stability: {eval_metrics['mean_policy_stability']:.4f}")
```

**Training Process:**
1. Reset environment and initialize state history
2. Reset analytics module for new episode
3. High-level agent generates initial strategic goal
4. Low-level agent executes monthly allocation decisions following the goal
5. Record each step in analytics module (state, action, reward, goal, invested amount)
6. Store transitions in episode buffer
7. Update low-level policy when buffer reaches batch size
8. Every `high_period` steps (default: 6):
   - Compute high-level reward over the period
   - Update high-level policy
   - Generate new strategic goal
9. Handle final updates at episode termination
10. Compute episode metrics from analytics module
11. Track and print progress every 100 episodes (including stability and goal adherence)

**Training Metrics:**
The trainer tracks comprehensive metrics throughout training:
- `episode_rewards`: Cumulative reward per episode
- `episode_lengths`: Number of steps per episode
- `cash_balances`: Final cash balance per episode
- `total_invested`: Total invested capital per episode
- `low_level_losses`: Policy loss for low-level agent
- `high_level_losses`: Policy loss for high-level agent
- `cumulative_wealth_growth`: Total invested capital (from analytics)
- `cash_stability_index`: % months with positive balance (from analytics)
- `sharpe_ratio`: Risk-adjusted performance (from analytics)
- `goal_adherence`: Alignment with strategic goals (from analytics)
- `policy_stability`: Consistency of decisions (from analytics)

**Usage Example:**
```python
from src.agents.financial_strategist import FinancialStrategist
from src.utils.config import TrainingConfig
import numpy as np

# Create training configuration
training_config = TrainingConfig(
    num_episodes=5000,
    gamma_low=0.95,
    gamma_high=0.99,
    high_period=6,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate_low=3e-4,
    learning_rate_high=1e-4
)

# Initialize strategist
strategist = FinancialStrategist(training_config)

# Aggregate state from history
state_history = [
    np.array([3200, 1400, 700, 1000, 0.02, 0.5, 50]),
    np.array([3200, 1400, 720, 1100, 0.02, 0.5, 49]),
    np.array([3200, 1400, 690, 1200, 0.02, 0.5, 48]),
    # ... more states
]
aggregated_state = strategist.aggregate_state(state_history)

# Generate strategic goal
goal = strategist.select_goal(aggregated_state)
print(f"Goal: target_invest={goal[0]:.2f}, safety_buffer={goal[1]:.2f}, aggressiveness={goal[2]:.2f}")

# Learn from high-level experience
high_level_transitions = [
    Transition(aggregated_state, goal, None, high_level_reward, next_aggregated_state, done)
    for aggregated_state, goal, high_level_reward, next_aggregated_state, done in episode_data
]
metrics = strategist.learn(high_level_transitions)

print(f"Training metrics: loss={metrics['loss']:.4f}, entropy={metrics['policy_entropy']:.4f}")

# Save trained model
strategist.save('models/financial_strategist.pth')

# Load trained model
strategist.load('models/financial_strategist.pth')
```

**State Aggregation:**
The strategist aggregates recent state history to compute strategic-level features:
- Average cash balance over last N months
- Average investment return (estimated from cash changes)
- Spending trend (linear fit slope of variable expenses)
- Current wealth (most recent cash balance)
- Months elapsed in the episode

**Goal Generation:**
Goals are constrained to valid ranges:
- `target_invest_ratio`: [0, 1] using sigmoid activation
- `safety_buffer`: [0, ∞) using softplus activation
- `aggressiveness`: [0, 1] using sigmoid activation

**Reward Components:**

Low-Level Reward (monthly):
- Investment reward: `α * invest_amount` (encourages investment)
- Stability penalty: `β * max(0, threshold - cash)` (penalizes low cash)
- Overspend penalty: `γ * overspend` (penalizes excessive spending)
- Debt penalty: `δ * abs(min(0, cash))` (heavily penalizes negative balance)

High-Level Reward (strategic period):
- Aggregated low-level rewards over 6-12 months
- Wealth change: `λ * Δwealth` (rewards cash balance growth)
- Stability bonus: `μ * stability_ratio * period_length` (rewards consistent positive balance)

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

You can also create configurations manually using dataclasses:

**Environment Configuration:**
```python
from src.utils.config import EnvironmentConfig

config = EnvironmentConfig(
    income=3200,              # Monthly salary
    fixed_expenses=1400,      # Fixed monthly costs
    variable_expense_mean=700, # Average variable expenses
    inflation=0.02,           # Annual inflation rate
    safety_threshold=1000,    # Minimum cash buffer
    max_months=60            # Simulation duration
)
```

**Training Configuration:**
```python
from src.utils.config import TrainingConfig

config = TrainingConfig(
    num_episodes=5000,        # Training episodes
    gamma_low=0.95,          # Low-level discount factor
    gamma_high=0.99,         # High-level discount factor
    high_period=6,           # Strategic planning interval
    batch_size=32,           # Training batch size
    learning_rate_low=3e-4,  # Low-level learning rate
    learning_rate_high=1e-4  # High-level learning rate
)
```

**Reward Configuration:**
```python
from src.utils.config import RewardConfig

config = RewardConfig(
    alpha=10.0,    # Investment reward coefficient
    beta=0.1,      # Stability penalty coefficient
    gamma=5.0,     # Overspend penalty coefficient
    delta=20.0,    # Debt penalty coefficient
    lambda_=1.0,   # Wealth growth coefficient

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Decision-Making**: Separates strategic and tactical financial decisions
- **Realistic Simulation**: Models fixed/variable expenses, inflation, and economic uncertainty
- **Configurable Risk Profiles**: Supports conservative, balanced, and aggressive strategies
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balances long-term wealth growth with short-term stability
- **Standard RL Interface**: Built on Gymnasium for easy integration with RL frameworks

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive performance metrics through the `AnalyticsModule`:

### Core Metrics

| Metric | Description | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cumulative Wealth Growth** | Total invested capital over simulation | Higher is better - indicates long-term wealth accumulation |
| **Cash Stability Index** | Percentage of months with positive balance (0-1) | Higher is better - indicates financial stability |
| **Sharpe-like Ratio** | Mean balance / std balance | Higher is better - indicates better risk-adjusted performance |
| **Goal Adherence** | Mean absolute difference between target and actual investment | Lower is better - indicates better goal following |
| **Policy Stability** | Variance of actions over time | Lower is better - indicates more consistent decision-making |

### Using Analytics in Your Code

```python
from src.utils.analytics import AnalyticsModule

# Initialize analytics
analytics = AnalyticsModule()

# During episode execution
for step in range(episode_length):
    state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    analytics.record_step(
        state=state,
        action=action,
        reward=reward,
        goal=goal,  # Optional: from high-level agent
        invested_amount=info['invest_amount']  # Optional: from env info
    )

# Compute metrics at episode end
metrics = analytics.compute_episode_metrics()

# Access individual metrics
print(f"Wealth Growth: ${metrics['cumulative_wealth_growth']:.2f}")
print(f"Stability: {metrics['cash_stability_index']:.2%}")
print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {metrics['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
print(f"Goal Adherence: {metrics['goal_adherence']:.4f}")
print(f"Policy Stability: {metrics['policy_stability']:.4f}")

# Reset for next episode
analytics.reset()
```

## Quick Start

### Training the HRL System

Train the system using the main training script with either YAML configuration files or predefined behavioral profiles:

```bash
# Train with a behavioral profile (recommended for quick start)
python3 train.py --profile balanced --episodes 5000

# Train with a YAML configuration file
python3 train.py --config configs/conservative.yaml

# Train with custom settings
python3 train.py --profile aggressive --episodes 10000 --output models/aggressive_run --seed 42

# Train with evaluation
python3 train.py --profile balanced --episodes 5000 --eval-episodes 20
```

**Command-line Options:**
- `--config PATH`: Path to YAML configuration file
- `--profile {conservative,balanced,aggressive}`: Use predefined behavioral profile
- `--episodes N`: Number of training episodes (overrides config)
- `--output DIR`: Output directory for trained models (default: models/)
- `--eval-episodes N`: Number of evaluation episodes after training (default: 10)
- `--save-interval N`: Save checkpoint every N episodes (default: 1000)
- `--seed N`: Random seed for reproducibility

**Training Output:**
The training script will:
1. Load and validate configuration
2. Initialize all system components (environment, agents, trainer)
3. Execute training with progress updates every 100 episodes
4. Save trained models and training history
5. Run evaluation episodes and display performance metrics

**Saved Files:**
- `{config_name}_high_agent.pt` - Trained high-level agent (Strategist)
- `{config_name}_low_agent.pt` - Trained low-level agent (Executor)
- `{config_name}_history.json` - Complete training history with all metrics

### Evaluating Trained Models

After training, evaluate your models using the evaluation script to assess performance and generate visualizations:

```bash
# Basic evaluation with trained models
python3 evaluate.py --high-agent models/balanced_high_agent.pt --low-agent models/balanced_low_agent.pt

# Evaluate with specific configuration
python3 evaluate.py --high-agent models/balanced_high_agent.pt --low-agent models/balanced_low_agent.pt --config configs/balanced.yaml

# Evaluate with custom episodes and output directory
python3 evaluate.py --high-agent models/balanced_high_agent.pt --low-agent models/balanced_low_agent.pt --episodes 50 --output results/

# Evaluate without generating visualizations
python3 evaluate.py --high-agent models/balanced_high_agent.pt --low-agent models/balanced_low_agent.pt --no-viz

# Evaluate with reproducible results
python3 evaluate.py --high-agent models/balanced_high_agent.pt --low-agent models/balanced_low_agent.pt --seed 42
```

**Command-line Options:**
- `--high-agent PATH`: Path to trained high-level agent model (.pt file) [required]
- `--low-agent PATH`: Path to trained low-level agent model (.pt file) [required]
- `--config PATH`: Path to YAML configuration file (optional)
- `--profile {conservative,balanced,aggressive}`: Use predefined behavioral profile (optional)
- `--episodes N`: Number of evaluation episodes (default: 20)
- `--output DIR`: Output directory for results and visualizations (default: results/)
- `--seed N`: Random seed for reproducibility
- `--no-viz`: Skip generating visualizations

**Evaluation Output:**
The evaluation script will:
1. Load trained models from checkpoint files
2. Initialize environment with specified configuration
3. Run evaluation episodes using deterministic policies
4. Compute comprehensive performance metrics
5. Display detailed evaluation results
6. Save results to JSON file
7. Generate trajectory visualizations (unless --no-viz is specified)

**Generated Files:**
- `{config_name}_evaluation_results.json` - Comprehensive evaluation metrics and statistics
- `{config_name}_trajectory_visualization.png` - Episode trajectory plots showing:
  - Cash balance over time
  - Allocation actions over time (invest, save, consume)
  - Cumulative investment growth
  - Rewards over time
  - Goal adherence (target vs actual investment)
  - Total expenses over time
- `{config_name}_summary_statistics.png` - Statistical analysis showing:
  - Distribution of episode rewards
  - Distribution of final cash balances
  - Distribution of total investments
  - Performance metrics comparison

**Performance Metrics Reported:**
- Mean reward ± standard deviation
- Mean episode length (months survived)
- Mean final cash balance ± std
- Mean total invested ± std
- Mean cumulative wealth growth ± std
- Mean cash stability index (% positive balance months) ± std
